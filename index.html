      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>A space for all stakeholders across autonomous system reliability to come together to discuss the key remaining problems and present progress made towards solving them.</p>
    </main>
    <main class="container">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>Not just verification, evaluation, or software engineering, but a holistic view of how we engineer reliable autonomous systems.  For the purposes of this conference, “autonomous systems” is synonymous with "systems that make their own decisions and can take their own actions," and includes everything from autonomous decision-making software running in a virtual environment to teams of autonomous robots operating in a distributed physical environment, everything from simple reactive systems with no planning capability to complex systems incorporating machine learning and reasoning engines.  Contributions addressing aspects of reliability across the entire life cycle of the system are welcome.</p>
