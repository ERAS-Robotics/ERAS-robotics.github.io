Cognitive Robots and Systems at University of Bremen, Germany.  Prior
to joining University of Bremen in 2023, he held positions at
Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg,  German Aerospace Center (Deutsches
Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt), and the University of Luxembourg.
His research lies at the intersection of AI-enabled Robotics and
Software Engineering, with an emphasis  on assuring dependability,
transparency, and explainability of robotics and autonomous systems,
benchmarking and performance evaluation, and domain-specific modelling
and languages for robotics. He is the co-founder of the RoboCup@Work
competition and his team became a world champion in 2023. In 2023, he
received the Ring of Honor of the VDI (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure) in
recognition of his achievements and numerous scientific contributions
in the field of robotics and AI. He is a co-chair of the IEEE RAS
Technical Committee on Software Engineering for Robotics and Automation.
